<h1>Tsundiary is a place to write stuff.</h1>

<p>Every day, you get a blank entry like this.</p>

<div class="post">
  <div class="post_top">
    <span class="post_date">Today</span>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p><textarea id="edit_area" placeholder="How was your day? N-not that I care or anything..." readonly></textarea></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>You can write whatever you want in it.</p>
<p>Also, you're shown old entries at nicely spaced intervals.</p>
<p>Before you know it, you'll have a huge 400-day combo and over a year's worth of memories. Sound good?</p>

<h1><a href='{{ url_for('register') }}'>Register!</a></h1>
